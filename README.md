# Desktop-Lab
Packer and Vagrant files to build desktop VMs.

The fastest way to bring up the VMs is:
1. Create a new project folder
2. Run: "vagrant init detectionlab/win10" or "vagrant init bento/ubuntu-18.04"
3. Edit the VagrantFile which was created (optional)
4. Run: "vagrant up"
5. Add the VM to VMWare after it is created
